# Spotify Playlist

**Spotify Playlist** is a Python based command line application that uses the Spotify API (Spotipy) to access public playlists and find songs that intersect in 2 or more playlists. Users can input the URL to the playlist they would like to check, and using the unique ID that each playlist has, we can parse through the playlists and find every similar song in the playlists.
